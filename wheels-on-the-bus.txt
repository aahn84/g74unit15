the wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round
the wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish!
the horn on the bus goes beep, beep, beep!
the doors on the bus go open and shut! open and shut!
the driver on the bus says "Move on back! Move on back!"
the dog on the bus says "arf arf arf"
the baby on the bus says "waah waah waahhh" ;(
